GitHub Tutorial
Thank you for taking the time to go through my writing sample. The documentation was created to showcase the basic tutorial for setting up a [readme.md]
page on your GitHub profile.
The documentation was created by adhering to the [Microsoft style guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) to maintain the readability and 
clarity of the procedure.
The document allows the user to follow precise steps with the result being a [readme.md](http://readme.md/) page, for a more in-depth view I have embedded a video 
showing the same procedure.
I hope the technical document demonstrates my strength and ability to communicate technical concepts simply and effectively. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Thank you!
Mehak Aga
